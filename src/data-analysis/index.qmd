# Abstract

This research investigates the impact of planned versus reactive autonomy and their effects on error detection results in automated drone systems. We analyze response times, detection accuracy, and age-related performance variations across different error types including camera, flight, and hardware errors.

# Introduction

## Background

Error detection and response times are crucial components in automated operations. This study compares two fundamental approaches:

- **Planned Autonomy**: Systematic monitoring, preventive error checking, and response-based error handling triggered by system anomalies in a visible preplanned flight path.
- **Reactive Autonomy**: Systematic monitoring, preventive error checking, and response-based error handling triggered by system anomalies in a non-visible autonomous flight path.

## Research Questions

1. How do response times differ between planned and reactive autonomy error detection scenarios?
2. What impact does user age have on error detection effectiveness?
3. Which error types are most commonly handled in each scenario?

# Methods

## Data Collection

Data was collected through simulated error scenarios across multiple instances and error types. Participants from various age groups interacted with both planned and reactive detection systems.

## Analysis Framework

Our analysis focuses on three key metrics:

1. Error detection rates (caught vs. missed)
2. False positive occurrences
3. Response time distributions
4. Comparison of average response time

For detailed visualizations and analysis of the results, please see the [Experiment Results](analysis.qmd) section.

# Key Findings

1. **Response Time Variations**: [Insert key findings about response times]
2. **Age-Related Patterns**: [Insert findings about age group differences]
3. **Error Type Impacts**: [Insert findings about different error types]

# Discussion

## Implications

1. [Key implication 1]
2. [Key implication 2]
3. [Key implication 3]

## Future Research

Further investigation could explore:

1. Long-term effectiveness of each approach
2. Integration of hybrid detection methods
3. Optimization strategies for specific error types
