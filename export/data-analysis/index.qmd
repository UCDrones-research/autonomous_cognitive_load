# Abstract

This research investigates the effectiveness of planned versus reactive error detection approaches in automated systems. We analyze response times, detection accuracy, and age-related performance variations across different error types including camera, flight, and hardware errors.

# Introduction

## Background

Error detection and response systems are crucial components in automated operations. This study compares two fundamental approaches:

- **Planned Detection**: Systematic monitoring and preventive error checking
- **Reactive Detection**: Response-based error handling triggered by system anomalies

## Research Questions

1. How do response times differ between planned and reactive error detection approaches?
2. What impact does user age have on error detection effectiveness?
3. Which error types are most effectively handled by each approach?

# Methods

## Data Collection

Data was collected through simulated error scenarios across multiple instances and error types. Participants from various age groups interacted with both planned and reactive detection systems.

## Analysis Framework

Our analysis focuses on three key metrics:

1. Error detection rates (caught vs. missed)
2. False positive occurrences
3. Response time distributions

For detailed visualizations and analysis of the results, please see the [Experiment Results](analysis.qmd) section.

# Key Findings

The analysis reveals several significant patterns in error detection effectiveness:

1. **Response Time Variations**: [Insert key findings about response times]
2. **Age-Related Patterns**: [Insert findings about age group differences]
3. **Error Type Impacts**: [Insert findings about different error types]

# Discussion

## Implications

The findings suggest important considerations for implementing error detection systems:

1. [Key implication 1]
2. [Key implication 2]
3. [Key implication 3]

## Future Research

Further investigation could explore:

1. Long-term effectiveness of each approach
2. Integration of hybrid detection methods
3. Optimization strategies for specific error types
